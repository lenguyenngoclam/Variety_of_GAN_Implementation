## Cycle GAN

- I choose monet2photo dataset. You can download this dataset with following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/monet2photo)

- It took me approximately 4 hours to train 1 epoch of this model so i can not have enough computing resources to train the model as specified in the paper. The result i have can not be called good but it can capture the overall texture and style of real photo from the input image, the things was lacking is that the color in the output image isn't right.
